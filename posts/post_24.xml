            XLink is the XML way of tackling the issue of creating links between documents.
            It is very similar to it's HTML counterpart, the &lt;a&gt; tag. But having a
            dedicated element for handling linking is not in XML's spirit ( it would impose
            unnecessary restrictions that would hamper flexibility ), therefore this
            functionality is implemented in a separate namespace (
            xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink ), and attributed to elements with by
            setting certain properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be used for the roles fulfilled by &lt;a&gt; in HTML - to enable the user to
            navigate to a different document; but they're more versatile, and have a number
            of attributes that control it's behaviour.
        </p>

            An XLink can be of two types: simple and extended. The simple XLink has similar
            similar capabilities to traditional HTML links: they provide a uni-directional
            connection between two resources.
