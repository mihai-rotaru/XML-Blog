            Logical data modeling usually occurs largely at a high level, outside the
            constraints of particular technologies, such as XML or SQL. However, since the
            resulting data model will ultimately be implemented in one ( or more ) of the
            available technologies, the logical data model might be adjusted for the
            particular computing system on which the physical data model is to be
            implemented - in this case, XML.
        </p>
        <p>
            A logical data model consists of three main components: entities, attributes,
            and relationships
            (http://web.archive.org/web/20080509063521/http://www.dbmsmag.com/9506d16.html
            ). XML provides a robust platform for implementing entities and attributes, but
            relationships can be more difficult to express (
            http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/5538 ).
        </p>
        <p>
            The hierarchical structure of XML can be used to convey basic relationships,
            such as one-to-one and one-to-many; for example, a document called "Modules" can
            contain one or more "Tutor" elements. This can be thought of as expressing
            either an one-to-one relationship ( if the module only has one tutor ), or as
            one-to-many, if the module contains multiple "Tutor" elements.
