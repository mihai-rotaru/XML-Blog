            XSL was developed initially as a specification for defining how an XML document
            is to be displayed. Over the course of it's evolution, it split into three
            components: XSL Transformation ( XSLT ), XSL Formatting Objects ( XFO ), and
            the XML Path ( XPath ). XPath, unlike XSLT and XFO, does not have an XML
            syntax; it is used to specify parts of an XML document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much like CSS3 modules, the different components of XSL can have different a
            status and version, although XPath and XSLT usually have the same version
            because they are developed in tandem. Support for XSL technologies varies
            with browsers and applications, but overall browsers have good support for XSL,
            for quite a long time; Internet Explorer 5 supported the XSLT1.0 draft
            specification since 1999, although the final recommendation was different from
            the draft.

        <p>
            Currently, all major browsers fully implement the XSLT1.0 specification.
            However, even though XSLT 2.0 reached the W3C Recommendation status in 2007,
            support for it remains rare in browsers, and XSLT 1.0 remains in widespread
            usage.
