        <p>
        XML validation is the process by which a document is checked to ensure the
        document is a well-formed XML document, and also that it's structure
        corresponds to it's declared Document Type Definition ( DTD ) or XML Schema. If
        a document is not well-formed, it cannot be valid.
        </p>

        <p>
        An XML parser can be either validating or non-validating, depending on it's
        ability to validate an XML document against a DTD or an XML Schema. A
        non-validating XML processor will only check for correct syntax, and interrupt
        parsing at the first encountered error. A validating parser will first perform
        the well-formedness test, and then proceed ( if the document is a well-formed
        XML document ) to check whether the contents match the description in the
        DTD/XMS. Unlike the well-formedness test, a validating parser is free to choose
        the course of action when validity errors are encountered; the parser can
        simply stop parsing and exit, or it could notify the user of the error and then
        continue parsing.
        </p>

        <p>
        The output of an XML validator depends on the implementation; the XML standard
        allows for some flexibility in this regard. It would most likely consist of a
        list of errors encountered, such as the w3schools validator
        (http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp ).
